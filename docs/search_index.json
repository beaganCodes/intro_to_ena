If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

W., &amp; Ruis, A. R. (2021, February). How we code. In International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography (pp. 62-77). Springer, Cham. Data preparation starts with a thorough qualitative analysis of the data (or sample of the data). This facilitates informed interpretation of the data, hypothesis generation, and identification of constructs that may explain the cognitive, behavioral, or interactive phenomena of interest. Theory-based (top-down coding) Emerging from data (bottom-up coding) Mixed methods To locate constructs in their data, researchers develop a system for determining which constructs are present in which parts of the data. That system can be as simple as a human rater reading each line to determine whether a given construct is in evidence. When researchers work with large datasets, it is not possible to make coding decisions manually for every excerpt. To identify key constructs in data at scale, researchers often develop automated coding algorithms. Codebook 2.2 Coding Validation Regardless of the coding process used, researchers need to validate their codes to establish that the coding decisions are consistent and accurate. This requires, at a minimum, establishing sufficient agreement between two independent human raters (for manual coding) or between two independent human raters and the automated coding algorithms (for automated coding). 2.3 Data Formatting Formatting your data for ENA "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
