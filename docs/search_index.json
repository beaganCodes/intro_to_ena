Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) has two main characteristics: it visualises patterns of connections among codes in a discourse; it enables a comparison of multiple networks. In comparison to other types of networks, for example, Social Network Analysis, ENA focuses on the content rather than structure of a network. Here are two video examples of ENA: A comparison of a discourse by different detectives discussing a case A comparison of press conferences held by Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern and the President of the United States Donald Trump on the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) ENA is a method that emerged from the field of Quantitative Ethnography (QE). For more information on QE and ENA watch the keynote by David Williamson Shaffer: And check the QE repository: LINK In this tutorial we are going to …. 1.1 ENA workflow Grounded Analysis QE researchers begin with a thorough qualitative analysis of their data (or sample of their data). This facilitates informed interpretation of the data, hypothesis generation, and identification of constructs that may explain the cognitive, behavioral, or interactive phenomena of interest. Data Coding To locate constructs in their data, researchers develop a system for determining which constructs are present in which parts of the data. That system can be as simple as a human rater reading each line to determine whether a given construct is in evidence. Automated Coding Process When researchers work with large datasets, it is not possible to make coding decisions manually for every excerpt. To identify key constructs in data at scale, researchers often develop automated coding algorithms. Coding Validation Regardless of the coding process used, researchers need to validate their codes to establish that the coding decisions are consistent and accurate. This requires, at a minimum, establishing sufficient agreement between two independent human raters (for manual coding) or between two independent human raters and the automated coding algorithms (for automated coding). Model Specification Once a dataset has been coded for the constructs of interest, researchers develop models of those codes to conduct exploratory or confirmatory analyses. This involves selecting a technique that can model the relationships among codes found in the qualitative analysis, and choosing variables that define the unit of analysis and other model parameters. Here, a particular emphasis in QE is aligning the quantitative model with the pattern observed in the qualitative analysis, so that the quantitative model can warrant that the grounded pattern observed is consistent throughout the data. Qualitative Regrounding (Loop Closing) Finally, researchers confirm that a result from their model is meaningful through a process of qualitative regrounding. That is, they confirm that the outputs and explanatory properties of a model are aligned with the findings of their original grounded analysis, thus closing the interpretive loop.

Data preparation starts with a thorough qualitative analysis of the data (or sample of the data). This facilitates informed interpretation of the data, hypothesis generation, and identification of constructs that may explain the cognitive, behavioral, or interactive phenomena of interest. Theory-based (top-down coding) Emerging from data (bottom-up coding) Mixed methods To locate constructs in their data, researchers develop a system for determining which constructs are present in which parts of the data. That system can be as simple as a human rater reading each line to determine whether a given construct is in evidence. When researchers work with large datasets, it is not possible to make coding decisions manually for every excerpt.

You can still change your settings, in the manual mode (See Chapters 4-6). To finish specifying a model, click on Finish. Figure 4.9: Review page in the tutorial mode 4.3 Plot operations The ENA webtool offers three plot visualizations (See Figure 4.10): Primary Plot [1] and Secondary Plot [2] show singular networks for each comparison group. Comparison Plot [3] shows a subtracted networks of values of the primary plot and the secondary plot. The connections among codes are color-coded by the comparison group. All visualizations are created either by clicking on the network means in the comparison plot (See Figure 4.10) or by clicking on different plotted points in any plot (See Figure 4.11). You can zoom in [4] or out [5] on any of the plots, or you can recentre the plot view [6] (See Figure 4.10). To switch between the primary with the secondary plots click on two arrows [7]. There is a possibility to exclude [9] or hide [8] either the primary or secondary plot from the comparison network. To download your plot, click on the cloud icon [10]. This will trigger a pop-up window with plot selection. Once you click on Export, you will download a zip file with your plots in png format. Figure 4.10: Plot operations Figure 4.11: Plotted points networks 4.4 Set operations Once you created a set, there are several operations that you can perform. Click on the three dots icon that will appear, when you hover over your set’s name. This will trigger a pop-up window with several options (See Figure 4.12): Use Copy Set [2] to create several variations of your model. When you click on Copy Set, a pop-up window will appear, where you can name the new set. Click on Copy, and a copy of the original set will appear in the set list. Export Set &amp; Data [3] is useful to share your model with others or to explore how a model would have been developed using the R programming language.
